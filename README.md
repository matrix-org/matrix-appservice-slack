A bridge that connects [Matrix](https://matrix.org) and [Slack](https://slack.com). 
The bridge is considered **stable** and mature for use in production
environments.

## Requirements

Hosting this bridge requires you to have a Matrix homeserver. In order to
connect a Slack Workspace to your bridge, you will need permission to add bots
to it. You will also need Node.JS 16+ or Docker on your system.

**NOTE:** Slack has introduced a new type of 'Slack App', which is not compatible with this bridge. Instead, you will need to [create a "Classic Slack App"](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1) for this bridge. Existing installations will not need to modify their setups, as all pre-existing Slack apps became Classic Slack apps. We are looking to make the bridge compatible with both types, but in the meantime please only use Classic Slack Apps.

## Setting up

See [the getting started docs](https://matrix-appservice-slack.rtfd.io/en/latest/getting_started)
for instructions on how to set up the bridge.
