environments.

## Requirements

Hosting this bridge requires you to have a Matrix homeserver. In order to
connect a Slack Workspace to your bridge, you will need permission to add bots
to it. You will also need Node.JS 10+ or Docker on your system.

## Setting up

See [the getting started docs](https://matrix-appservice-slack.rtfd.io/en/stable/getting_started/)
for instructions on how to set up the bridge.

has the time to spare. If you want to work on the bridge, please see
