2.0.1 (2022-10-06)
==================

This release fixes a bug in our build system that prevented Docker images from being built. Users not using Docker on `2.0.0`
are not required to upgrade.

2.0.0 (2022-10-05)
==================

Note, as with `2.0.0-rc1`, release requires **Node.16** or greater.

Bugfixes
--------

- Add missing `reactions:write` scope to oauth scopes. ([\#696](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/696))
- Fix PostgreSQL schema 14 not applying cleanly if `events` containing NULL columns. ([\#701](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/701))

  user to stop working. The bridge will now **automatically delete** any puppeted connections which violate this rule. You will be notified via the bridge when
  this happens, so you can relink your accounts. ([\#705](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/705))
