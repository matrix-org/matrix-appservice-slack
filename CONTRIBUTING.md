## Slack Guidelines

 - The official support/development room is [#slack:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#slack:half-shot.uk)

## Building the documentation

You can build a rendered version of the help documentation by using `mkdocs`.

This requires you to have `python3` and `pip` installed.

```sh
# For Debian-based platforms
$ apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip3 install -r docs/requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```
